Gives you a price table post type, with an easy to use builder and an attractive design.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you a drag and drop interface for building price tables. It also renders those price tables using pure CSS3. They have a clean, minimal design - so they'll fit into just about any design (thanks [Orman](http://www.premiumpixels.com/freebies/simple-pricing-table-psd/))

Read our [release post](http://siteorigin.com/pricetable-wordpress-plugin/) to find out more about this plugin.

I'm offering free support as I build this plugin up to version 1.0. Just hop on our [support forum](http://siteorigin.com/forum) - no signup required.
